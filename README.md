# CBC Radio Player #
This is a bare-bones HTML5 application built on Sench Touch. It was mainly done for fun and a proof of principle that the CBC should be supporting a more platform agnostic approach rather than developing exclusively for iOS.

## Supported browsers
Although the above paragragh suggests it should run anywhere, I'm unwilling to support all the edge cases.  So far it has been tested in: 

* Chrome
* Safari
* Mobile Safari

It should work in any modern browser that supports HMTL5 audio tags.
