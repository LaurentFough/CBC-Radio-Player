# CBC Radio Player #
This is a bare-bones HTML5 application built on Sench Touch. It was mainly done for fun and a proof of principle that the CBC should be supporting a more platform agnostic approach rather than developing exclusively for iOS.

## Supported browsers
Although the above paragragh suggests it should run anywhere, I'm unwilling to support all the edge cases.  So far it has been tested in: 

* Chrome
* Safari
* Mobile Safari

It should work in any modern browser that supports HMTL5 audio tags.

## Web-Page
You can try the application out through your desktop or mobile webbrowser at [CBC Radio Player](http://caryan.github.com/CBC-Radio-Player). For seme reason Firefox doesn't render it particularly well.  Your best luck will be with a Webkit based browser like Chrome or Safari.
